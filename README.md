# VR independent living

More than 2 million people in England over the age of 75 live alone, and more than a million say they go over a month without speaking to a friend or family member. This issue has been further exacerbated by the pandemic. Our product aims to reduce the impact of loneliness on older people by connecting them with loved ones in an immersive way. 

Users will be able to enter a room with a friend and speak as they wish with the immersive nature of such a room allowing for a closer, more intimate meeting than alternatives such as voice or video calls.
